:description: This dataset is made up of two feature classes, Contract Jobs Multipoint and Contract Jobs Line. The only distinction between the two is in the means used to graphically depict the job location (points). These feature classes indicate where city-generated, contract or grant construction jobs are underway or completed. Attributes include information on the project number, name and description as well as the city engineering contact names.
