:description: TSP classifications are part of a group of layers that make up the Transportation System Plan, which is the 20-year plan for transportation improvements in the City of Portland. The goal of the TSP is to provide transportation choices for residents, employees, visitors and firms doing business in Portland by describing what the system should look like and what purpose it fulfills. This linear feature class contains the street classifications of the TSP. Attribution for classifications under Traffic, Transit, Bicycle, Pedestrian, Freight, Emergency Response and Street Design designate the type of movement and planning that should be emphasized on each street.
