:description: This polygon feature class participates in the group of layers that make up the Pedestrian Classification of the Transportation System Plan (TSP). Pedestrian Districts are areas wherein high levels of pedestrian activity exist or are planned and where the intent is to make walking the mode of choice for all trips within that district. This includes areas such as the Central City, Gateway regional center, town centers and station communities. An attribute indicates the name of the pedestrian district.
