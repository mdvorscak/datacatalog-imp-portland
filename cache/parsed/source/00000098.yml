:description: In 2003 Portland Parks & Recreation staff began inventorying ecological conditions within the city's natural areas. All field survey data is organized in relation to specific geographic boundaries called Vegetation Units as represented in this layer. Initial mapping of Vegetation Unit boundaries is done by visual interpretation of orthophotos. During subsequent field surveys boundaries are modified so that Vegetation Units represent areas of homogenous vegetative and ecological conditions.
