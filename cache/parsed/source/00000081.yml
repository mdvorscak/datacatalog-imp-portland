:description: All spatial and temporal data that describes the scheduled transit service. This is bulk data in CSV format according to the Google Transit Feed Specification (GTFS). TriMet schedules start on Sunday at 12:00 a.m. and generally are valid until the following Sunday at 12:00 a.m. Schedules are not always published each week, so a published schedule may remain valid for more than one week. Schedules usually are published no later than 6:00 p.m. on Saturday.
